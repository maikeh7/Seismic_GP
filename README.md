This repository contains code to simulate seismic events via a class called Seismogram that integrates with obspy and instaseis. 
You must have access to a local syngine database for this code to work properly (you can find out more here: https://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/syngine/). It is recommended that you create a new virtual environment in which to run this code.
